### Key projects

#### [r2modman(Plus)](https://github.com/ebkr/r2modmanPlus)

My primary project is r2modmanPlus, which initially started as a rewrite of a mod manager for Risk of Rain 2 that I had created during my second year of university.

It uses TypeScript/Vue/Electron and was designed to be an entry point into modding games without having to have much, if any, computer knowledge prior.
The design decisions try to conform to [Nielsen's Heuristics](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/) wherever possible to ensure that the software is easy to use.

The overall project has been in development since 2019 and remains actively developed as of 2023-11-24.

At the time of writing, the average monthly user count is approximately 80k.

Additionally this project forms the base of the Thunderstore Mod Manager, which has its own user count with a similar, if not greater, number of users.

#### [H3VR.BT2TS](https://github.com/ebkr/H3VR.BT2TS)

Now archived, this project was used to aid transitions from BoneTome, an old modding site for BONEWORKS, to [Thunderstore](https://thunderstore.io). 

The project downloaded and repackaged mods from the BoneTome site based on the contents of the download, and produced a usable README to make the entire process essentially one-click.

Over 100 mods were repackaged by other authors using this tool.
